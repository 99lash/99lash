## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **John Asher Manit**, a `computer science` student arising out of  Manila, Philippines ðŸ’».

I love learning and exploring technologies while working out my ass to help with social-online problems of future technologies which aid the communities at ease. Through offering/providing a quality experience & interface and memorable online entertainment as possible.
